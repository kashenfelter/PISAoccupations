**Compare countries in time** plots students' mean performance on vertical axis and year on horizontal axis.
Plots showing two countries are displayed side-by-side for comparison. 
Colors refer to ISCO categories. 
Hovering over lines or points on the plot displays a tooltip that gives a name of the category, it's mean performance
and more information.
This plot helps answer questions like:  
    * Did the structure of results change over years?   
    * Did the spread in results got bigger or smaller?  
    * Did the spread change because of one or more categories?  

4. **Compare all countries** plots students' mean performance on horizontal axis and names of the countries on vertical axis. It helps find out for example:  
    * Which countries achieve the best mean results?  
    * How are top countries different between subjects?  
    * How big is the difference between best- and worst-performing countries?  
By default all ISCO categories are displayed. You can focus on some of them or just country means by clicking 
**Details** and unchecking categories.
