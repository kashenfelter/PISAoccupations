For details and examples please read [this document](https://github.com/mi2-warsaw/PISAoccupations/raw/master/inst/extdata/about.pdf).  

In each study students' skills in mathematics, reading and science were tested. You can switch between subject by clicking items on the **Subject** list.
Similarly, first three plots show data from one study. 
Selecting an item on the **Year** list changes displayed year. 
Clicking each tab at the top of this page takes you to a different kind of a plot.

PISA study along with several other large-scale assessment studies uses plausible values methodology.
As a result, mean students' performances and other statistics (and their standard errors) must be calculated in a non-standard way. For details please refer to [PISA technical report](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012technicalreport.htm).
Calculations were performed using accompanying R package that can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/mi2-warsaw/PISAoccupations).
Raw data can be found on [OECD website](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/) under **Databases** category.

The application was created by Mateusz Staniak (Institute of Mathematics, University of Wrocław) under Przemysław Biecek's supervision.
