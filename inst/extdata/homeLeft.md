1. **Compare categories in time** plot display students' mean performance on vertical axis and year of study on horizontal axis.   
This plot helps you answer questions like:  
    * In which categories the results improved over years?  
    * Are the trends in two countries similar or different?  
    * In which categories difference between countries became smaller/bigger?
    
By default all ISCO categories are displayed. You can focus on some of them by clicking **Details** and unchecking categories. You can also uncheck **Show standard error** or **Show trend** checkbox to make the plot simpler.

2. **Compare two countries** plots students' mean performance on vertical axis. Some of questions it may answer are: 
    * Do the countries have similar structure?   
    * In which country the difference between children from best- and worst-performing category is bigger?
    * Which categories have mean results better than their country's mean?
