This application helps to explore the relation between parents' occupations and child's performance. **Performance** in reading, mathematics and science literacy is measured in [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/) studies. You will find more information about these measures [here](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results.htm). **Occupations** are classified according to [ISCO - International Standard Classification of Occupations](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/) major groups. These are: 1 -	Managers, 2 -	Professionals, 3 - Technicians, 4 -	Clerical Support, 5 - Services and Sales, 6 - Skilled Agricultural, 7 - Craft, 8 - Plant and Machine Operators, 9 -	Elementary Occupations. Occupations that are not listed in ISCO but identified in PISA, such as student or housewife, are assigned to the category 9.
