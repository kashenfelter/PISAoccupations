# Trends in PISA occupations.

This application aims to help explore the relationship between parents' occupations and child's performance in PISA study. Occupations are classified according to [ISCO](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/).
Below a quick overview of provided graphical tools is given.

***

In each study students' skills in mathematics, reading and science were tested. 
You can switch between subject by clicking items on the **Subject** list.
Similarly, first three plots show data from one study. 
Selecting an item on the **Year** list changes displayed year. 
Clicking each tab at the top of this page takes you to a different kind of a plot.

1. **Compare categories in time** plot display students' mean performance on vertical axis and year of study on horizontal axis.   
This plot helps you answer questions like:  
    * In which categories the results improved over years?  
    * Are the trends in two countries similar or different?  
    * In which categories difference between countries became smaller/bigger?
    
By default all ISCO categories are displayed. You can focus on some of them by clicking **Details** and unchecking categories. You can also uncheck **Show standard error** or **Show trend** checkbox to make the plot simpler.

2. **Compare two countries** plots students' mean performance on vertical axis. Some of questions it may answer are: 
    * Do the countries have similar structure?   
    * In which country the difference between children from best- and worst-performing category is bigger?
    * Which categories have mean results better than their country's mean?
    
3. **Compare countries in time** plots students' mean performance on vertical axis and year on horizontal axis.
Plots showing two countries are displayed side-by-side for comparison. 
Colors refer to ISCO categories. 
Hovering over lines or points on the plot displays a tooltip that gives a name of the category, it's mean performance
and more information.
This plot helps answer questions like:  
    * Did the structure of results change over years?   
    * Did the spread in results got bigger or smaller?  
    * Did the spread change because of one or more categories?  

4. **Compare all countries** plots students' mean performance on horizontal axis and names of the countries on vertical axis. It helps find out for example:  
    * Which countries achieve the best mean results?  
    * How are top countries different between subjects?  
    * How big is the difference between best- and worst-performing countries?  
By default all ISCO categories are displayed. You can focus on some of them or just country means by clicking 
**Details** and unchecking categories.

PISA study along with several other large-scale assessment studies uses plausible values methodology.
As a result, mean students' performances and other statistics (and their standard errors) must be calculated in a non-standard way. For details please refer to [PISA technical report](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2012technicalreport.htm).
Calculations were performed using accompanying R package that can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/mi2-warsaw/PISAoccupations).
Raw data can be found on [OECD website](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/) under **Databases** category.

The application was created by Mateusz Staniak (Institute of Mathematics, University of Wrocław) under Przemysław Biecek's supervision.
